    "\n",
    "Polymorphism, a core element of OOP, allows different classes or objects to be treated interchangeably as if they belong to a shared category. In other words, polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on different forms or behave in different ways depending on the context in which they are used. In object-oriented programming (OOP), polymorphism is achieved through the use of inheritance, interfaces, and method overriding. Let's dive deeper into this topic:"

As we've journeyed through this guide, we've unlocked the doors to encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction—four pillars that have the power to reshape the way we design, build, and maintain software. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;\">1) With encapsulation, we've learned to safeguard our data and grant it only to those who truly need it, like a treasure protected by a guardian. </p>\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;\">2) Inheritance has allowed us to build upon the wisdom of our predecessors, creating new classes with the knowledge of the old, just like the passing down of wisdom from one generation to the next.</p>\n",

    "1. Class - in Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating related attributes and methods into one unit.\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",
    "2. Method - in OOP, functions inside of a class are referred to as methods, representing actions that objects of the class can perform.\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",
    "3. Object - an instance of a class.\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",
    "4. Parent Class - In OOP a \"parent class\", also known as a superclass or base class, is a class that is extended or inherited by one or more \"child classes\" or subclasses. The parent class contains attributes and methods that are common to its subclasses.\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",
    "5. Subclass - in OOP, also known as a \"child class\", is a class that inherits methods and attributes from another class, called the superclass or parent class. This means that a subclass can reuse the code from its superclass.\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n",
    "6. super() is a built-in function that returns a temporary object of the superclass, which allows you to call its methods. This is especially useful in the context of inheritance, where you might want to call a method of the superclass from within a method of a subclass.\n",

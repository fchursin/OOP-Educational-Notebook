## Overview

Welcome to the OOP-Educational-Notebook! This codebook serves as a comprehensive guide to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It aims to provide a clear explanation of the four main pillars of OOP and a comparison between OOP and procedural programming. You can explore [the full OOP notebook at once](https://github.com/ur0vn1t31/OOP-Educational-Codebook-WIP/blob/main/OOP.ipynb) or go to [the OOP_in_to_parts directory](https://github.com/ur0vn1t31/OOP-Educational-Codebook-WIP/tree/main/OOP_in_two_parts) where I split the material into two parts to make it easier to understand!

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful paradigm used in various programming languages, including Python. It provides a structured way of organizing code, making it more modular, maintainable, and reusable. This notebook aims to explain OOP principles in Python and highlight its advantages over procedural programming.

## Comparison with Procedural Programming <a name="comparison"></a>

This section will provide a detailed comparison between OOP and procedural programming, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) <a name="oop"></a>

OOP is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects. In Python, everything is an object, including data and functions. This paradigm emphasises the clear distinction between classes as definitions of data and methods for a given type or class of object, and objects as instances of these classes.

## The Four Pillars of OOP <a name="four-pillars"></a>

### 1. Encapsulation <a name="encapsulation"></a>

Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. This unit hides the internal implementation details and exposes a well-defined interface for interacting with the data. It helps in data protection and reduces the complexity of the code.

### 2. Inheritance <a name="inheritance"></a>

Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. It promotes code reuse by creating a hierarchy of classes. In Python, a new class can inherit properties and behaviors from a base class, and then extend or override them to create specialized classes.

### 3. Polymorphism <a name="polymorphism"></a>

Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It allows you to write code that can work with objects of various types, making your code more flexible and adaptable.

### 4. Abstraction <a name="abstraction"></a>

Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential characteristics and behaviors they share. It hides the unnecessary details and exposes only what is relevant, making the code more manageable and understandable.

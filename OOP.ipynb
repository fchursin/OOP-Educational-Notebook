    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;\"> In the world of Python programming, mastering the art of Object-Oriented Programming is like discovering a secret passage to a realm of limitless possibilities. As we've journeyed through this guide, we've unlocked the doors to encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction—four pillars that have the power to reshape the way we design, build, and maintain software. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;\">1) With encapsulation, we've learned to safeguard our data and grant it only to those who truly need it, like a treasure protected by a guardian. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;\">2) Inheritance has allowed us to build upon the wisdom of our predecessors, creating new classes with the knowledge of the old, just like the passing down of wisdom from one generation to the next.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;\">3) Polymorphism has given us the gift of flexibility, allowing us to write code that dances with grace and elegance, adapting to different situations like a chameleon changing colors. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;\">4) Abstraction, the master key, has opened the door to simplification, making complexity vanish into the shadows, revealing only the essence of what truly matters. </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;\"> As we conclude our exploration of Object-Oriented Programming in Python, remember that the power of OOP isn't merely in the syntax or the code itself; it's in the way it transforms our thinking. With these four pillars as your foundation, you have the tools to craft solutions that are not just functional but elegant, not just robust but adaptable, and not just code but works of art. </p>\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;font-size: 18px;\"> So go forth, Pythonista, armed with the wisdom of OOP, and let your creativity flow through your code.

    "# The ABCs of OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Class - in Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating related attributes and methods into one unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Method - in OOP, functions inside of a class are referred to as methods, representing actions that objects of the class can perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Object - an instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Parent Class - In OOP a \"parent class\", also known as a superclass or base class, is a class that is extended or inherited by one or more \"child classes\" or subclasses. The parent class contains attributes and methods that are common to its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Subclass - in OOP, also known as a \"child class\", is a class that inherits methods and attributes from another class, called the superclass or parent class. This means that a subclass can reuse the code from its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. super() is a built-in function that returns a temporary object of the superclass, which allows you to call its methods. This is especially useful in the context of inheritance, where you might want to call a method of the superclass from within a method of a subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own but serves as a blueprint for other classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Abstract methods are methods declared in an abstract class but have no implementation in the abstract class itself."

def what_is_encapsulation():

    return ("Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts of OOP. It bundles data (attributes) and related operations (methods) within a single class, ensuring cohesion. It also restricts external access to some of this data using mechanisms like private and protected specifiers, maintaining object integrity and consistency.")

def what_is_inheritance():

It allows for the creation of a new class, based on an existing class, bringing forward its behaviors and attributes, while having the flexibility to introduce new ones or modify the existing traits.")
